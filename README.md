# DL-Jewelry-Image-Classification
In this project, I developed a deep learning solution to classify images of various types of jewelry, utilizing two distinct models. The primary focus was on creating a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, while the second approach involved leveraging the pre-trained VGG16 model to explore transfer learning for jewelry classification.
